# Deep-Learning-Cosmic-Void-2019

This project uses ##Convolutional Neural Network## to spot cosmic voids from a given galaxy catalog!

Collaborator: [Joshua Yao-Yu Lin](https://github.com/joshualin24), PhD student in university of illinois urbana champaign
Data from: Arka Banerjee, PhD student in university of illinois urbana champaign

Codes are ran on NCSA [Hardware-Accelerated Learning (HAL) cluster](https://wiki.ncsa.illinois.edu/display/ISL20/HAL+cluster)-This work utilizes resources supported by the National Science Foundationâ€™s Major Research Instrumentation program, grant #1725729, as well as the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
